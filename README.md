# converting-files-from-a-format-to-txt-and-back-while-maintaining-the-hex-code-structure.
A python file converter that converts a file from a certain format to a txt format, as well as another file that converts it back while maintaining its hex code.

Its original use was to convert some files in a Japanese game ROM I was hacking to txt so that I can find the Japanese text and translate it to English.

It works on most formats, but it's not for unpacking a file, only for getting its hex data in readable format.

Useful when dealing with hex code.
